# Exploring Visualization Techniques for Wi-Fi Networks in Smart Homes

This repository contains the code for a network visualization module designed for Home Assistant.

To be implemented:
- LuCi API will be used to gather DHCP information
- OVS API will be used to gather communication information
- In a Home Assistant Dashboard a force-directed graph will be implemented.
  The nodes within the graph will contain the devices connected to the OpenWRT router.
- Clicking on a note displays tabular information about the device
